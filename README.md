# AssemblyPrograms
A Repository for my Assembly Language class homework and tests

## Summary
While pursuing my Bachelor of Science at Sacramento State University,
I may take several classes involving assembly language.
I doubt I will be using asm in any of my professional or personal work,
so I think it best to keep everything I've learned in once central repository,
as a quick reference for future classes.

## Using the Project
Most of these files are purely referential: they cannot run on my machine.
Throughout the semester,
I've been using the Console32 template in Visual Studio on a virtual machine specifically configured for this class,
so I have no clue how to properly configure this on any other device.
